I also have experience writing code in Python, R, and SQL. Outside of school, I’m a <strong>huge</strong> sports fan, particularly baseball, basketball, and football. I also enjoy reading and playing video games. I also had a blast studying abroad in London last semester. I’m looking forward so adjusting back to school in Syracuse.</p>
