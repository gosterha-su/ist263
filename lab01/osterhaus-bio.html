    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Griffin Osterhaus. I’m an Applied Data Analytics major interested in consulting, sports analytics, and political analysis. I am fluent in the Microsoft Office Suite. I also have experience writing code in Python, R, and SQL. Outside of school, I’m a huge sports fan, particularly baseball, basketball, and football. I also enjoy reading and playing video games. I also had a blast studying abroad in London last semester. I’m looking forward so adjusting back to school in Syracuse.
